# React Image Search

This project demonstrates the agility and ease with which React can generate dynamic flex user interfaces, as well as easily do API network calls ( in this case leveraging the Unsplash image search API ).

To see in action, clone the project -- quickly set up an API key at (Unsplash)[https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications].

Test out in two simple steps:
1.) Run `npm install` to load all the project's npm module dependencies 
2.) Run `REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_API_KEY='YOUR-UNSPLASH-API-KEY-HERE' npm start`
